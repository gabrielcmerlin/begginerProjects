# Begginer Projects

The duo formed by Gabriel da Costa Merlin [12544420] and Mateus Bernal Leffeck [13673318] did 2 projects
during the 1st semester of 2022 for the Introduction to Computer Science I subject taught by the professor
Ricardo Marcondes Marcacini. The first project is a Simplified Genetic Algorithm made to find roots
of equations, while the second is a Smart Agenda in which we can, among other things, insert, delete
and search for contacts.
